                <b>The reason we have created this website is because the Earth is in desperate need for our help. Alongside with us you 
            can help Earth to go back to its designated health, green and beautiful form. These are some of the things you can adjust 
            to your everyday life to become even more eco-friendly.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Conserve water at home.</b>
                Wasting water is one of the biggest ways individuals impact the health of the planet. 
                Taking measures to use less water is something you can start doing right away.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Use fewer chemicals.</b> 
                Chemicals used to wash our bodies, homes, cars and everything else get washed down the drain or absorbed in the grass, 
                and eventually, end up in the water supply. Since most people use heavy-duty chemicals for all sorts of things, chemicals 
                are doing real damage to waterways and aquatic life.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Switch to LED light bulbs in as many lights as you can.</b> 
                LED light bulbs do cost more than conventional light bulbs, but the benefits outweigh the cost. They use 
                25-85% less energy, last 3-25% longer, and are much better/safer for the environment.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <b>Use less electricity.</b>
                Coal and natural gas are the most common sources of energy that gets turned into electricity. The burning of these 
                substances is a major factor in world air pollution. Reducing your reliance on electricity is a great way to play a part 
                in saving the planet.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Buy local goods.</b> 
                Buying local helps combat air pollution in two ways. You don't have to travel as far to get what you need, and products 
                don't have to travel as far to get to you, either. Making smart choices about where your food, clothes, and other goods 
                come from can help make a dent in air pollution.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Use less heat and air conditioning:</b>
                Use less air conditioning and heat, or just keeping your house 2 degrees lower in winter or 2 degrees higher in summer can make a big difference.
